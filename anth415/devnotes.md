- first discovery October 2013
-  largest collection of hominin fossils from a single species ever to be discovered in Africa (Dirks)
- Previously unknown
- Dinaledi Chamber of the Rising Star cave system
- limited faunal bones, mostly from humans
- extensive collection of 1550 hominin specimens, representing nearly every element of the skeleton multiple times 
- Two separate chambers - the Dinaledi Chamber and the Lesedi Chamber
- two field expeditions, November 2013 and March 2014

- Cradle of Humankind, South Africa
- The Dinaledi chamber is located approximately 30 meters underground, as is the Lesedi Chamber
- No direct route between chambers
- The word naledi means ‘star’ in the Sotho language and refers to the Dinaledi Chamber's location within the Rising Star cave system.
- Lesedi Chamber, a word meaning ‘light’ in Setswana. (Hawks et al. 17)
- Dinaledi Chamber (‘Chamber of Stars’ in the Sotho language) (Dirks)
-  800 meters southwest of the well-known site of Swartkrans in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, Gauteng Province, South Africa.


> Quick Figures
// put float list of number icons here
2013 - first discovery
1550 - number of hominin specimens
15 - least number of individuals represented by the specimens

> Skull Features
- "While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal." (Berger)
- Notable for having an incredibly intact skull within the specimens
- Re-fitted nearly complete skull components (Hawks)
- "Cranial morphology of H. naledi is unique, but most similar to early Homo species including Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis." (Berger)

// From HAWKS
Homo skulls
H habilis - 
H rudolfensis -
H naledi - similar frontal morpholohy with habilis and erectus, which are not found in rudolfensis (such as frontal bossing and supratoral sulcus). anterior vault shared with erectus, along with slight postorbital construction and a posterior position of the temporal crest on the supraorbital torus. also, shares angular torus with erectus. facial morphology is more distinct from erectus and habilis
The nasal bones of naledi do not project markedly anteriorly, although like many specimens of erectus, naledi has a projecting nasal spine. naledi has a relatively flat lower face
similar but less extreme than rudolphensis
H erectus - variable in size. shared many features with naledi and habilis
- "Cranial morphology of H. naledi is unique, but most similar to early Homo species including Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis." (Berger)

// From STRINGER image
Homo habilis - relatively high and thin skull, small brian volume, rounded occipital, no transverse torus, large teeth with molars increasing towards the back

Homo erectus - relatively low and thick skull, small-medium brain volume, flexed occipital, transverse torus, large teeth, molar gradient varies

Homo floresiensis - relatively low, thick skull, small brain volume, flexed occipital, transverse torus, small teeth, molars decrease towards back

Homo naledi - relatively high and thin skull, small brain volume, flexed occipital, transverse torus, small teeth, molars increase towards back

> Bone Samples
- "H. naledi has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb." (Berger)
- many samples were extrodinarily well-presered, which is huge because of the quantity of samples involved
- " the small brain size, curved fingers and form of the shoulder, trunk and hip joint resemble the prehuman australopithecines and the early human species Homo habilis." (Stringer)
- Wrist, hands, legs, and feet look more like Neanderthals" (Stringer)
- "Teeth have some primative features... but they are relatively small and simple" (Stringer)

> Dating
- "the material from the Lesedi Chamber is undated" (Hawks et al 17)
- "stratigraphy is complex" (Hawks 17)
- due to sediment erosion, " uncertain how much of the hominin assemblage may remain in its primary depositional context." (Hawks 17)
- might be more than 2 million years old, but could be as recent as 100,000 years old (Stringer)
- Being only from one site, dating and spread of the species is difficult to assess
- attemps to measure age lacking (Stringer)
- commentators writing on the discovery suggest radiocarbon dating or DNA samples might be possible (Stringer)

> Mysteries
- large number of fossils very close, with no large animal remains, and remains aren't damaged by predators or scavengers (Dirks)
- How did they get there?
- "living in the cave or being washed in by a flood were considered but ruled out" (Hawks 17)
-  "the evidence is most consistent with the bodies arriving intact into the chamber, and there were no signs that the remains had been exposed to the surface environment." (Hawks et al 17)
- "intentional disposal of the dead bodies is a surprisingly complex behaviour for a creature with a brain no bigger than that of H. habilis or a gorilla" (Stringer)
- "alternative explanations, ranging from whether H. naledi occupied the caves to whether the bodies were left there by predators" (Stringer)
- "represents a depositional scenario that deviates from all other hominin localities in the region" (Dirks)
- "there is no indication of a direct vertical passageway to surface into the Dinaledi Chamber" (Dirks)
- "There are no signals of occupation debris or evidence of occupation within the Dinaledi Chamber" (Dirks)
- "Sedimentological evidence excludes the transport of coarse-grained material into the chamber by water action." (Dirks)
- "if bodies were dropped down the entrance, it is unlikely that they would have fallen rapidly, or landed with any force; perhaps because the entry is too irregular and narrow to allow a body to freefall and gain speed, or perhaps because a pile of soft muddy sediment had accumulated below the entry way, breaking the momentum of any falling object" (Dirks)
- quality of the bones suggest deliberate, careful burial as opposed to dropping bodies
- "eliberate disposal of bodies in the Dinaledi Chamber implies that morphologically primitive hominins like H. naledi may have had their own distinctive patterns of behavioral complexity, even though the reason why H. naledi may have ventured deep into the cave system remains unresolved." (Dirks)

- problem: access to the chamber is so narrow it is limited to smaller bodied people (Val)
- non-trivial maount of effore required to move the dead bodies to the cave chamber (Val) without causing trama to them
- likely deposited over an extended period of time, if they were deposited (Val)
- some researchers contest the conclusions about the state of the bones, and the plausibility of the burial hypothesis. further investigation is suggested, but uncertain how it might be undertook (Val)

> Conclusion
- Homo had complex origins, especially with mixed characteristics on the unearthed specimens (Stringer)
- Interesting compare and contrast with other species of Homo
- Lack of precise dating leaves a lot to be desired about this discovery
- Still groundbreaking due to the quantity and quality of specimens uncovered
- The mystery surrounding the results of the Homo Naledi expeditions, and the possibility of complex behavior like burials taking place, makes Homo Naledi a truly fascinating discover
